# Java Project for Demonstation

This project contains some simple, generic Java code in a Gradle project used to demonstrate building Java into a container.

See the Katacoda scenario for [Distillation Pattern with the JRE](https://www.katacoda.com/javajon/courses/kubernetes-fundamentals/distillation) to learn how it's used.

The code was inspired from the related article [GraalVM: Native Images in Containers](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/graalvm-native-images-in-containers) by [Oleg Å elajev](https://github.com/shelajev).
